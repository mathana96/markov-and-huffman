# Markov and Huffman - best buds

## Project Specification as follows;

In this assignment you are asked to implement in either Octave or Java code to

* generate Huffman codewords based on observed frequencies in a source
* encode message using Huffman codewords
* decode the encoded message and verify that it matches the original for a source that is represented by a single random variable distribution and by a Markov process.

The implementation can be in Octave or Java, or Python and the required functions/methods are described in the following pages.

** Full spec can be found [here](https://denflynn.bitbucket.io/NetworkTheory/08-Markov_Chains/02-Coding_Assignment/00-Outline.html)**
